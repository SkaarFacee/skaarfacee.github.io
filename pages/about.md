# **About Me**

Hi I'm **{{ site.author.name }}**,<br>
I'm an aspiring AI Engineer with a passion for building intelligent systems. My journey into the world of artificial intelligence began with my undergraduate studies in Artificial Intelligence Engineering at Amrita University, and I'm currently expanding my knowledge through a Master's program in AI.

My professional experience includes working as a Data Scientist at IHX, India's largest healthcare data exchange platform. There, I gained valuable experience working with data from major hospitals across the country, contributing to meaningful advancements in healthcare data management.

I'm a dedicated coder, and I find immense satisfaction in developing and refining AI models. I'm driven by a desire to create innovative solutions and am always eager to take on new challenges in the field of AI.
